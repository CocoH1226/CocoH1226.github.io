                                        After my group interviewed our target users, we consolidated common mentorship struggles, and were
                                        able to quickly build multiple preliminary design wireframes that guided the overall direction of 
                                        the later prototypes of ConnectU. Left shown is one that I designed to be considered by my group.

                                        I contributed significantly to the group's iterative design process by first setting up appropriate user testing protocols, such as identify user group, creating
                                        comprehensive instructions, obtaining user consent, and creating scenarios for users. Next, by interviewing with multiple target 
                                        users on the design and usability aspects of our initial wireframe, observing their reaction and behavior, and summarizing patterns from these observations and 
                                        translate them into actionable feedback to inform our next iteration. I contributed to shaping the core features of ConnectU, such as the Nav bar, Home Screen, 
                                        creating incentives mechanism, and I proposed installing a playful activity system designed to strengthen mentor–mentee bonds would greatly
                                        attract users.

                                        Using Figma, my group and I refined all clickable components, testing interactions and page flows, and adjusting 
                                        the design based on feedback to improve usability and clarity. I helped the team decide color palette based on 
                                        color-analysis and usability dimensions, and I incorporated multiple icons and imageries to make the prototype appear 
                                        more engaing and intuitive to first-time users.

                                    Are you a professor, recruiter, mentors, friend, or just curious peers who want a 
                                    quick, honest portrait of who I am? The goal for the website is simple: I built my 
                                    pages so anyone can land, skim, and jump exactly to where they need to learn about ME.
                                </p>
                                <p class="about-design">
                                    What did I prioritize in this design? For me, learnability, consistency, and, of course, 
                                    creative sparks! That’s why you are not only seeing clean navigation and card-based layouts 
                                    that make the site instantly approachable, but also BOLD color combos (hope you enjoy the dark background!) 
                                    and engaging hovering animation that makes you WANT to STAY. On the home page, I presented an image me so the profile 
                                    is balanced and expressive. And my Projec pages shows covers of my projects that give you a snippet of what they look like.
                                    The goal was a design that feels intuitive enough to let the content speak for themselves!

                                <p class="about-design"> 
                                    How did I get here? To begin, I started with a standard Bootstrap portfolio template and 
                                    rewrote substantial portions of the layout to match the intended structure. To list 
                                    a few things: I customized classes for CSS-styling and recreated components to introduce my own spacing, 
                                    fonts, and hover interactions on top of the default Bootstrap template; I also layered in Google Fonts so that certain titles 
                                    are emphasized; I linked my projects, socials, and resume as embedded links so that users are directed to a new tab when they want to learn more about them…
                                </p>
                            <h2 class="AIeval">Evaluation on use of Generative AI Tools for UX Deisgn </h2>
                                <p class="about-design">
                                    During the design process, I found GenAI very helpful in terms of spotting over-riding of Boostrap and Css on demand and helpig with 
                                    many other types of errors——perhaps debugging in general. If I got lost during spotting an error, GenAI can usually quickly identify
                                    the mistyped place/mistake and provie with a helpful solution. This helped me optimized layout and overall styling, making the process more efficient.
                                    Regardless, GenAI is particularly terrible with judgment and creting a prototype from scratch by following text prompts. It does not often generate the 
                                    most creative, human-readable design just by following instructions. And the result of GenAi can largely deviate from what what 
                                    a designed generally wnats. The results are often generic and roboitic, as compared to human-made prototype.
